    "text": "Visualizing Data in Wildlife Research\n\nThe Power of Data Visualization\nData visualization is an essential tool for understanding complex patterns, trends, and relationships within data. By transforming raw numbers into meaningful graphics, we can communicate insights more effectively and uncover patterns that might otherwise go unnoticed. One of the most influential frameworks for creating visualizations is the Grammar of Graphics, which provides a structured approach to building data-driven graphics. This concept, popularized through ggplot2 in R, allows us to construct visualizations by layering data, aesthetic mappings, geometries, and statistical transformations.\n\n\nMy Research: Exploring Bighorn Sheep Ecology\nI am a Master’s student at the University of Idaho, studying bighorn sheep habitat use and population dynamics. My research focuses on how ewes’ interactions with their environment influence survival, as well as how social structures impact habitat selection and population dynamics. Through this blog, I will explore data visualization techniques to analyze spatial ecology, survival, and habitat selection, demonstrating how effective visualizations can enhance ecological research.\n\n\nWhat to Expect from This Blog\nThis blog will be a place for me to track my progress, exploration, troubleshooting, and successes with coding data visualizations. By documenting my process, I aim to create a personal reference guide to help myself navigate challenges and refine my skills. Along the way, I hope that sharing my experiences will also be helpful to others who are working with ecological data, R programming, and visualization techniques."

    "title": "Action-Target Pairs: Visualizing Bighorn Sheep Behavior",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Understanding how bighorn sheep behave in different group sizes provides insight into their survival strategies and social dynamics. Using visualization, we can explore patterns in vigilance and other behaviors to see whether larger groups of sheep exhibit different levels of attentiveness.\nIn the field of data visualization, we use Action-Target pairs to define how we interact with data. Actions describe the goal—whether we are discovering new patterns, presenting findings, or exploring relationships—while targets define what aspect of the data we focus on, such as trends, attributes, or spatial relationships.\n\nTask Abstraction\nIn this post, I will construct two visualizations and define them in terms of Action-Target pairs:\nPlot 1: Group Size vs. Number of Vigilant Individuals\n\nAction: Discover Trends – I aim to explore whether vigilance increases with group size.\nTarget: Trends in Behavioral Data – I will observe patterns in vigilance levels across different group sizes.\n\nPlot 2: Group Size vs. Number of Animals Performing All Behaviors\n\nAction: Summarize Behavior Distribution – I want to see the overall distribution of different behaviors as group size changes.\nTarget: Attributes of Behavioral Data – This will illustrate how different behaviors scale with group size.\n\n\n\nBiological Context\nGroup living in animals is often associated with benefits such as increased predator detection and enhanced foraging efficiency. In bighorn sheep, vigilance—a behavior where individuals scan their surroundings—plays a critical role in detecting predators. However, vigilance can be costly if it takes away from time spent foraging. One hypothesis is that in larger groups, individual vigilance decreases because more animals are contributing to predator detection.\nBy visualizing these relationships, we can determine whether vigilance is primarily driven by group size. Additionally, by looking at all behaviors collectively, we can assess whether certain behaviors become more or less frequent as groups grow larger.\n\n\nVisualizing the Data\n\nGroup Size vs. Number of Vigilant Individuals\nThis plot will help me determine whether the number of vigilant individuals increases proportionally with group size or if there is a threshold beyond which additional vigilant individuals no longer contribute to reducing their risk.\n\nobservations %&gt;%\n  left_join(group_behavior, by = \"group_id\") %&gt;%  \n  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = total, \n                       y = vigilant)) +  \n  geom_point(color = \"navyblue\", size = 2) +\n  labs(x = \"Group Size\",\n       y = \"Count of Vigilant Animals\",\n       title = \"Group Size vs. Vigilance\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGroup Size vs. Number of Animals Performing All Behaviors\nTo gain a broader perspective, I will compare group size with the total number of animals performing different behaviors. This will show whether some behaviors become more or less common as group size increases.\n\nobservations %&gt;%\n  left_join(group_behavior, by = \"group_id\") %&gt;%  \n  pivot_longer(cols = c(foraging, \n                        vigilant, \n                        traveling, \n                        bedded),\n               names_to = \"behavior\", \n               values_to = \"count\") %&gt;%  \n  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = total, \n                       y = count, \n                       color = behavior)) +\n  geom_point(size = 2) +  \n  labs(title = \"Group Size vs. Behavioral Counts\",\n       x = \"Group Size\",\n       y = \"Count of Behavior\",\n       color = \"Behavior\") +\n  theme_minimal()"
